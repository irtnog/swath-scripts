Introduction
============

This is my personal collection of extensions to the ​SWATH helper for
​TradeWars 2002.  For now it's limited to simple one-off scripts to
help me automate some of the more complicated tasks associated with
high-level play, but I hope to create some of the more sophisticated
tools that so far have only been available for older helpers.
